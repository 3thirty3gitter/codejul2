## ARCHITECTURE BASED ON REPLIT AGENT

### Backend Stack Recommendation:
- **API**: Node.js + Express or Python FastAPI
- **Database**: PostgreSQL + Redis for caching
- **File Storage**: AWS S3 or equivalent
- **AI Processing**: Perplexity API + OpenAI integration
- **Real-time**: WebSockets for live updates
