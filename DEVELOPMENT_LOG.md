Date: 2025-01-09
Status: ✅ READY FOR TESTING

## Phase 1: Persistent Project Context - IMPLEMENTED
- ✅ Enhanced session management
- ✅ Project context persistence  
- ✅ Cross-interaction memory
- ✅ Replit-style context awareness

## Files Created/Updated:
- ✅ applicationBuilderService.ts - Enhanced with persistent sessions
- ✅ applicationBuilder.ts - API routes with session support
- ✅ Backup files created for safety

## Next Steps:
1. Restart backend server
2. Test persistent context functionality
3. Verify Replit-level conversation continuity
4. Proceed to Phase 2: Multi-Step Problem Resolution

## Testing Scenarios:
1. "build a website to sell drones" → Should create session and remember "SkyVenture"
2. "make it modern" → Should reference existing "SkyVenture" project
3. "what's my project about?" → Should recall drone website details
